This project had difficult aspects.  Of those, fixTree() and addNode() gave the most problems. 
While doing them on paper was fairly easy, it was difficult to implement and think about 
the coding aspects of both the methods.  
This was especially true when a node was null and when the first few nodes had to be entered. 
Also, it was difficult at first to understand that Node is an inner class of RedBlackTree, 
although after looking at the tester it was possible. 

The following are the times it took to add the words of the dictionary to the Red Black Tree and the time it took to lookup/spellcheck the poem.  
Time to make dictionary: 304 milliseconds
Time to lookup poem: 21 milliseconds
