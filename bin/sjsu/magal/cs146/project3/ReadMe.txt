To run the tester (RBTTester.java) please run each test separately.  They work separately
 but running the whole tester class causes errors.  
 I talked to Professor Potika about this and she said to mention this.  
 Also, please note the change in color representation, 0 is black and 1 is red.  I changed this 
 in her given tester as well.
